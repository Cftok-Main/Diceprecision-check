# Diceprecision-check

Checking the precision of 6-sided dices with CHI² distribution-check.

With 6-sided dice every side has the chance to show up 1 time. Like 2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 3.

A bad dice can shop up a side more than one times because the sides are not flat enough, not in parallel, not same dimensions or the weight is missaligned.

The CHI² shows how precise a dice is manufactured.
